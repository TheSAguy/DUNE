dune_rules_2=The empire needs vast quantities of Melange and it's your job as current governor to harvest it. a lot of houses would love to have control over Dune, so be prepared for attacks to stop you from completing your goals
dune_rules_3=However, if you keep accomplishing your goals, even the Emperor might start to get worried...
dune_rules_6=Good luck!
dune_tips_1=Tips: Make sure to choose the Preset "DUNE" when starting a new game. Re-roll till you have Water and Melange in starting area. Deliver the Spice to the Palace. 
dune_tips_2=Tips: Most Buildings require workers to run. You'll get a new worker every 2 min. You can't place buildings on sand. You get a reward after each goal, check the palace
dune_tips_3=Tips: Visibility is poor on Dune due to sandstorms (MOD: BlackMap_0.0.2). Spice Harvesters come in handy (MOD: aai-vehicles-miner_0.4.7)
